# Repo Guidance for Codex

This repository is intentionally minimal and does not use any build tools or automated tests.

- When changing files, there is no need to run a build step or package manager.
- Simply keep the HTML, CSS and JavaScript self-contained.
- If future instructions mention running tests, you can safely skip them because no test suite is present.

You are free to edit or extend the web page directly in place.
